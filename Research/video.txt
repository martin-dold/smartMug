This video explains, how the capacitive sensor works, that we have found last time.



I guess we can implement it. We only have to check the possibilities of how to build it

in the university.

I would suggest, that we try to implement it, but also try to implement the weight

measurement, in case the first approach doesn’t work out, as wanted.
